## Welcome to my personal website!

This fully responsive website is developed with Next.js, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Sanity.io.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This project is connected to Sanity.io studio which means you will need to provide its projectId in .env.local file. Refer to .env.example for full requirements. In the development environment, the BASE_URL will be your localhost url.
